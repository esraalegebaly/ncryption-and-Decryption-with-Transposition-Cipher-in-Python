# ncryption-and-Decryption-with-Transposition-Cipher-in-Python
The goal of this project is to implement a transposition cipher in Python, focusing on the columnar transposition cipher. You will create a TranspositionCipher class that can both encrypt and decrypt messages using a provided key. Additionally, an optional challenge involves implementing a function to hack the cipher without knowing the key.
